      <p>
        In the last couple of years, AI assistants have become a part of many
        people&apos;s daily lives for performing and streamlining all sorts of
        everyday tasks. But they have a major shortcoming: they can gather
        information and answer questions in text format, but they can&apos;t
        take any actions on behalf of the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        At NEAR, we believe that the future is AI-first and that everyone will
        have their own AI assistant as the primary way to interact with
        computing and the Internet. Instead of various middleman companies
        capturing value from every user interaction, User-Owned AI should be
        powering assistants to focus on the individual user&apos;s success and
        wellbeing and to guarantee privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, NEAR AI is opening up access to NEAR AI Assistant (Alpha). You
        can check it out at <a href="https://chat.near.ai">chat.near.ai</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the first step in our journey to put a User-Owned AI in the
        hands of everyone in the world. The alpha version of NEAR AI Assistant
        is taking the first steps of executing actions on the user&apos;s
        behalf, such as preparing blockchain-based actions or shopping. It has
        user-specific memory and can act on the user&apos;s behalf in both Web2
        and Web3 by connecting with other AI agents and services. It does this
        by calling other agents to which it has access with a request for a
        specific action. The NEAR AI Assistant also knows how to present the
        response, either in text or by generating a rich user interface when
        it&apos;s needed.

      <p>
        We are open sourcing the whole platform to enable the community to build
        more integrations and functionality, as well as to offer the assistant
        to their own users. You can find the source code for the NEAR AI
        Assistant{' '}
        <a href="https://app.near.ai/agents/agentic.near/assistant/0.0.9/source">
          here
        </a>{' '}
        and the overall tooling{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/nearai/nearai">here</a>. It is designed to
        allow developers to contribute new functionality in a permissionless way
        by building specialized agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        We envision that in future versions, the NEAR AI Assistant will be able
        to predict users&apos; needs by analyzing context, perform complex tasks
        by coordinating a number of other agents performing different jobs, and
        even transact with third party services across both Web2 and Web3 on the
        user&apos;s behalf.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI has the power to make humans more efficient, productive, and
        collaborativeâ€”but this must not come at the expense of data ownership,
        privacy, and economic opportunity for individuals. While this alpha
        product is just the beginning of making User-Owned AI a reality, it is
        an important first step towards making sure the AI we use every day is
        privacy-preserving, community-built and -owned, and designed to benefit
        users not corporations.
      </p>
