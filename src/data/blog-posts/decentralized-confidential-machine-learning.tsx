        a pre-print of "Decentralized Confidential Machine Learning." We present
        a novel approach to training, fine-tuning, and utilizing models and
        agents that allows for the decentralized, transparent properties of open
        source while creating a business model for developers and researchers.

      <p>
        Currently, using advanced AI models requires giving up privacy of users'
        data and limits how models can be used. Meanwhile, open source models do
        not yet have a sustainable business model (not to mention, most open
        source AI is really just open weights). We present a decentralized
        system that enables the creation and deployment of LLMs and AI agents
        that are both open-source and monetizable; are private and verifiable
        while open for all to use; and preserve users' ownership of their data
        and assets while enabling customized experiences that improve their
        well-being.

        The paper presents a design for a confidential, decentralized AI cloud
        that combines Trusted Execution Environments or TEEs (CPU and GPU) and
        payment channels with a mechanism called{' '}

        to deliver service-level agreements in a decentralized environment. The
        DCML system is a big step towards making User-Owned AI a reality – and
        it makes use of new technology that has been available for less than a
        year.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team went down this research path in particular because we believe
        TEEs are the best way to guarantee both confidentiality and
        verifiability together, i.e. not just a guarantee that the computation
        being run is what you expect, but that only this specific computation
        was done on this data and no other. Other potential solutions, such as
        ZKML, don't offer confidentiality. And despite recent improvements,
        homomorphic encryption still comes with massive overhead, which presents
        a major challenge at scale. TEEs, on the other hand, give strong
        guarantees on both confidentiality and verifiability with less overhead:
        in fact, the bigger the model, the less overhead. They also offer the
        additional guarantee that only this specific computation was done on
        this specific data, which you don't get from other approaches. (Side
        channel attacks are possible, but this is an addressable problem.).
      </p>

      <p>
        We're using TEE to enable verifiable and confidential VM (CVM), in
        collaboration with Phala Network, to enable abstraction that anyone can
        use. This approach unlocks some powerful benefits:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Verifiable inference:</strong> load a model in and know your
          response isn't known by whoever is running hardware or software. You
          also get confirmation that the model you expected to be run, was
          indeed run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monetization of models:</strong> You can publish encrypted
          weights (which can only be decrypted inside the secure enclave) and
          then monetize the model since the secure enclave can enforce payment
          (streaming payments). Anytime someone wants to run inference, they
          attach proof of payment and get proof of compute used. Also supports
          monetization of user interactions without developers needing to deal
          with private data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine tune on top of these models</strong> with your own
          private data and run them on someone else's hardware, and you can
          either use your model privately or monetize it for others to run.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decentralized training:</strong> allows a set of participants
          to pool funds together, train the model, and share the profits in a
          decentralized manner (without trust requirements).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enables creators</strong> to add safety restrictions to
          models.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Decentralized confidential machine learning introduces end-to-end
        confidentiality and paths to monetization for both closed source and
        open source AI builders while offering solutions to some of the biggest
        problems facing the AI ecosystem today. We believe this decentralized
        system opens up paths to more distributed, energy-efficient AI systems;
        ensures global access for participants; and makes possible new use cases
        for which strict data confidentiality is required, whether corporate or
        personal.
