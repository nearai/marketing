        Today Illia and I published a preprint of "Proof of Response," a paper
        introducing a novel primitive for decentralized systems. Proof of
        Response is a novel mechanism for guaranteeing liveness and
        responsiveness of services, with a wide range of potential use cases.

        In summary: Proof of Response is a new primitive to guarantee liveness
        and responsiveness of services in decentralized systems. Because
        decentralized networks composed of many participants or nodes––such as
        blockchain networks or groups of AI agents––contain so many
        interdependencies, Proof of Response offers a path to better performance
        overall and incentives for participants to complete the services they
        promise. It also introduces a more granular way for nodes to provide
        particular services to other nodes to enable higher quality service
        provision across a distributed network.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Proof of Response, one participant or agent can request some data
        from another participant or agent, and either receive it, or prove to
        the system that the requested data has not been sent. This blog will
        illustrate how Proof of Response works by way of real world examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NEAR AI team believes that in the very near future, the majority of
        human tasks will be performed by a massive network of interconnected AI
        agents. My personal agent will work with a specialized travel agent to
        book my vacation, which in turn will work with agents specific to
        airlines and hotels, car services and restaurant reservations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the morning, my personal agent will work with a shopping agent to buy
        coffee when I'm running low. Then it will pull the weather from the
        weather agent to show, and potentially take some action, such as to
        change AC settings. It will take action, that is, if the weather agent
        is online and live. If the weather agent is down, my personal assistant
        agent needs to get creative: find another weather agent, or act without
        having all the necessary information.
      </p>
      <p>
        With millions of agents taking dependency on million other agents,
        agents going offline can cause chain reactions of downtime or suboptimal
        performance. For the system as a whole to work, there must be a way for
        agent providers to declare an uptime, and for the agent consumers to be
        able to punish providers if the declared uptime is not upheld.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem here is that if my personal assistant agent claims that the
        weather agent is offline, while the weather agent claims that it is
        online, there is no way for the system to verify which of the two of us
        is in the wrong. This problem is known as the "two generals problem" in
        computer networking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the simple case where the agent is either online for everyone, or
        offline for everyone, a system can be designed where once my personal
        assistant makes a claim that the weather agent is offline, a small
        number of validators ping the weather agent, and confirms whether it's
        online or offline. Instead, we want a mechanism that can handle more
        sophisticated cases, in which the agent might not be offline for
        everybody, but it doesn't want to serve a very particular request
        necessary for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core idea behind Proof of Response is a network of interconnected
        relayers that connect a set of service providers (agents or services)
        and users (agents, services, or old fashioned humans). When a user,
        let's call her Alice, wants to fetch some data from a service provider,
        let's call her Sarah, Alice chooses a path via the relayers such that
        she is connected to the first relayer on the path, and Sarah is
        connected to the last. Say the path is Alice - Bob - Charlie - David -
        Sarah. Alice then sends the request to Bob, saying that she wants data
        from Sarah, and specifying the path via which to relay the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each edge in the network, the protocol maintains the declared
        latency, and the cost to use it. The two participants on the two ends of
        the edge have a state channel open between them via which they route the
        payments for the messages. When Alice sends the message to Bob, both
        Alice and Bob know the cumulative latency of the path from Alice to
        Sarah. Once Bob has received the message, he must do one of the
        following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Send the response from Sarah to Alice, or</li>
        <li>
          Send to Alice a proof that one of the edges on her route to Sarah no
          longer exists.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Moreover, Bob must either do one of those two things within the
        cumulative declared latency of the edges on the path, or let's say for
        each 200ms (a number that Alice and Bob need to agree upon in advance)
        of delay, they would need to send Alice a small payment via their
        payment channel. Note that Bob must be sending those small payments for
        as long as he hasn't sent to Alice either the response from Sarah, or a
        proof of a broken edge. In particular, if Sarah chooses not to respond
        to the message, Bob will eventually have to send Alice a proof of a
        broken edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we now consider the protocol between Bob and Charlie, we will notice
        that for as long as Charlie sticks to the protocol, Bob will also be
        able to. Once Charlie sends Bob the response or the proof of a broken
        edge, Bob can forward it to Alice, and for every 200ms of delay, Bob
        forwards Alice the payment from Charlie. If Charlie deviates from the
        protocol, meaning that he doesn't send Bob the payment for the delay,
        Bob can choose to either break the edge, and thus still conform to the
        protocol, or wait for Charlie and pay the delay fee out of pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice pays for the message routed, and Bob, Charlie, and David all make
        money from messages sent by Alice and other users of the network. Thus,
        if Sarah ends up not responding to the message from Alice, for David it
        makes no sense to sacrifice their edge with Charlie, with whom they do
        business, and the most likely outcome is that an edge that is
        immediately incident to Sarah will end up being broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, Alice either receives the response from Sarah, with a small
        compensation for any delay, or receives proof that someone deviated from
        the protocol, and an edge was destroyed. In the latter case, Alice can
        continue issuing the same request over different paths, until Sarah is
        separated from the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof of Response doesn't itself impose any requirements on the message
        that Sarah sends to Alice besides the fact that it needs to be signed by
        Sarah. It is up to the protocols that build on top of Proof of Response
        to introduce validation of such messages, and procedures to enforce
        their correctness. This also means that Proof of Response can be used by
        many types of protocols and many different use cases, from AI to crypto
        and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        As another example, consider a data storage protocol. Protocols such as
        Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, and OnMachina have mechanisms in place to ensure
        that the providers of the storage store the file for the agreed upon
        duration, but they do not have a way to ensure that the data is served.
        In such protocols the data providers already have a stake that works as
        an assurance that the data is stored. With proof of response, the
        protocols can reuse the same stake to ensure that the data is also
        served. A user that wants to get data from the storage provider can
        request it via Proof of Response. As was shown above, they will either
        receive the response from the provider, or separate them from the
        network. The data storage protocol can build extra slashing mechanisms
        into their contracts that would slash the data provider if they get
        disconnected from the network, or if the user can provide any message
        signed by the data provider that doesn't adhere to the data storage
        protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we started working on Proof of Response, we noticed that there are
        many places where it can be helpful. For example, blockchain nodes would
        be easier to design if the nodes can be certain that their peers will
        respond to their block requests. AI inference providers such as
        Hyperbolic can provide provable guaranteed uptime to their users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, in a large network of AI agents, agent creators can
        provide assurances to the developers who want to take dependency on
        their agents that either their agents will be online and available, or a
        compensation will be paid out to the developer, all handled by smart
        contracts. This way, Proof of Response ensures liveness of agents in the
        agentic Internet of the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides liveness, we also need to ensure the safety of the agents,
        meaning that we want to make sure that the agents do what they claim to
        do, and do not leak private user data in doing so. Both of these
        guarantees can be ensured by using another technology called Trusted
        Execution Environments (TEEs). NEAR AI will be using Proof of Response
        as part of a system utilizing TEEs and will share another post about how
        it works very soon.
