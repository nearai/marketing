      <p>Enabling Fully Private, Verifiable AI Agents with Phala Network</p>

      <h2>TLDR:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The first open source private ML SDK, built by{' '}
          <a href="https://phala.network/">Phala Network</a> in collaboration
          with NEAR AI, is now live
        </li>
        <li>
          This initial piece of TEE infra will enable developers to build
          private + trusted AI agents, paving the way for many more agentic use
          cases & broader adoption
        </li>
        <li>
          Next step: a one-click version to run any model or agent through
          privacy-preserving infra on NEAR AI Hub
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        NEAR AI is building infrastructure to power the User-Owned AI stack. The
        base layer of this stack is TEE infrastructure for ensuring privacy and
        verifiability of all data and code. TEE stands for "trusted execution
        environment," meaning a secure area in a hardware processor that
        guarantees the code and data running through it are not accessible to
        the operator of the machine. These TEE processors––Intel CPUs and NVIDIA
        GPUs––enable confidential computing for a range of privacy-preserving AI
        apps with verifiable security guarantees.
      </p>

      <h2>Enabling Privacy-Preserving AI with TEE</h2>

      <p>
        Today, the first piece of TEE infra from NEAR AI – an SDK built by Phala
        Network – is now{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/nearai/Private-ML-SDK">live</a> and is fully
        open source. The NEAR AI team will use TEE infra to verify that all AI
        agents running inference via the NEAR AI Hub are private. This enables
        verifiably secure data – unlike many of today's popular AI agents, which
        offer no guarantees against stealing data nor how potentially sensitive
        inputs are being used to train models. Closed source AI companies have
        already made{' '}
        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/openai-ceo-says-a-bug-allowed-some-chatgpt-to-see-others-chat-titles.html">
          major
        </a>{' '}
        <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/italy/privacy-protection/1569616/data-privacy-violation-openaichatgpt-to-pay-a-fine-of-15-million-euros">
          mistakes
        </a>{' '}
        with compromising sensitive data and even today's most popular
        decentralized AI platforms are not providing any privacy or security
        guarantees for users' data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cryptographic assurance of TEEs opens up a lot of use cases that
        aren't possible with today's agents because of data sensitivity. With
        verifiable security guarantees, users and businesses alike can be
        confident that all of their data remains encrypted and protected
        throughout the entire AI process––from when it's first submitted by
        users, through the computation phase, until the final results are
        delivered.
      </p>

      <h2>Unlocking New Use Cases & Enterprise Adoption</h2>

      <p>
        TEE-powered AI infrastructure presents a quantum leap forward in the
        kinds of applications and use cases that can run on open-source AI
        models. With assurance that user data remains 100% private during AI
        inference and verifiable proof that AI computations are executed as
        intended, it is now possible to create open source AI solutions with
        sensitive financial data or healthcare records, as well as enterprise or
        even government applications. When combined with crypto-based payments
        and NEAR's identity and security features, this unlocks significant
        value for businesses and builders who were previously unable to safely
        work with first-generation AI agents, whether closed source or
        decentralized.
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes it possible for enterprises or data owners to work together
        without having to share any data or make it visible to one another. If
        Business A can run Business B's software on their own hardware, each
        provisioning services to one another and running compute over
        proprietary data while ensuring total privacy on both sides, a lot of
        new use cases become possible. One example might be, different hospitals
        or doctors' offices that each have health data they don't want to expose
        to one another can share information without violating confidentiality
        obligations.
      </p>

      <p>
        TEE infra also enables sensitive data to be used for fine tuning more
        specialized models without making that data visible to anyone––this
        could apply for the same example of medical records, resulting in much
        more effective models for health use cases overall. This also works for
        restricting how a model is used, including a model that results from
        such specialized fine-tuning. So it could explicitly prevent anyone
        running inference on sensitive data from making queries about that data.
        Likewise, this makes it possible to demand pay per usage of a model and
        enables monetization of model usage overall––more on this from NEAR AI
        soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        At a high level, this brings us closer to realizing the user-owned AI
        vision of an AI agent personal assistant that can interact with all of a
        user's data without compromising their privacy. Imagine AI agents for
        end users that can pay bills or even complete tax paperwork – with
        better security than today's Web2 and analog tools.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

      <p>
        The SDK is designed to support high-performance AI workloads while
        providing cryptographic proof that the computations were executed
        correctly and privately. Thanks to Remote Attestation, users also get
        proof that their application is running on genuine, secure hardware with
        the correct, unmodified code. Importantly, the solution from NEAR AI &
        Phala achieves this without significant performance penalties compared
        to running in a traditional way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SDK combines NVIDIA GPU TEE and Intel TDX technologies to create a
        secure, verifiable infrastructure for running AI models. TDX (Intel
        Trust Domain Extensions) is Intel's virtualization-based security
        technology used to create isolated, encrypted virtual machines that
        protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. GPU TEE is NVIDIA's
        confidential computing technology for graphics processing units to
        protect AI workloads and data during computation. The SDK also creates a
        reproducible system for trustless verification of AI computations while
        being permissionless and hardware agnostic.
      </p>

      <h2>Advancing AI Agent Frameworks</h2>

      <p>
        This first piece of TEE infrastructure is one step of many towards
        enabling private, verifiable AI that is truly user-owned. It will soon
        be integrated into the <a href="http://app.near.ai">NEAR AI Hub</a>{' '}
        agent hosting platform––and since it's open source, it's available for
        anyone interested to use right away. While it is not plug-and-play for
        all developers just yet, NEAR AI is committed to building in the open
        and making things open source along the way to encourage transparency
        and collaboration in the user-owned AI ecosystem.
