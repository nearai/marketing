      <p>
        At ETHDenver 2025, the NEAR AI team introduced an exciting collaboration
        of forward-thinking teams including NEAR AI and Coinbase Onramp &
        AgentKit: the Open Agents Alliance (OAA), an initiative to deliver
        powerful, open source AI services to all users by combining
        infrastructure. With secure infrastructure powered by TEEs, an
        innovative and inclusive payment rail, and cutting-edge AI technology,
        the OAA teams' shared mission is to ensure secure, open source,
        economical, and fair AI access for humanity, prioritizing user privacy
        and economic inclusivity for over 5.5 billion web users worldwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        "As the global web continues to shift toward mobile users, we believe AI
        must be accessible to everyone," said Illia Polosukhin, Co-Founder of
        NEAR AI. "In partnership with leaders in hosting, privacy, and payments,
        we're building a globally distributed network that can provide AI
        services securely, confidentially, and at no cost to end users. This
        effort spans far beyond the current 350 million blockchain users,
        extending the power of crypto to deliver accessible AI tools to all."
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the OAA, participating organizations will offer end-to-end
        solutions—including multiple agentic AI frameworks, traffic sources,
        cloud hosting, secured by TEEs, and frictionless on/off-ramps to both
        fiat and crypto. By allowing developers to seamlessly build and deploy
        AI, and by sharing revenue with the contributors, the Alliance is paving
        the way for <strong>free</strong> AI inference at scale. This united
        front aims to replace the traditional "pay-to-play" model with a
        user-first approach for the benefit of all 5.5 billion people connected
        to the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following teams are already working together and will share progress
        in the coming months. For more updates and to join the alliance, you can
