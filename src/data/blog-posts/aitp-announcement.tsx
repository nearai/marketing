        NEAR AI is releasing today a Request for Comments (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">RFC</a>) of{' '}
        <a href="http://aitp.dev">AITP</a>: Agent Interaction and Transaction
        Protocol. AITP enables AI agents to communicate securely across trust
        boundaries while providing extensible mechanisms for structured
        interactions. We anticipate a future where agents are the dominant
        interface for all online interactions and transactions, representing
        people, businesses, and institutions and communicating with users and
        each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        As AI is becoming more capable in decision-making and taking action,
        integrating more with existing tools, marketplaces, websites, and apps,
        it is clear that a lot of existing businesses and applications are going
        to be replaced by AI Agents. An AI agent is a system that combines
        reasoning capabilities via LLM and the ability to execute actions in the
        real world, just as humans are able to do. Three main types of AI agents
        are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Assistants: agent that works on behalf of the user and/or represents
          the individual
        </li>
        <li>
          "Service" agents: agents run by a person or a company for some task,
          where the company has access to all logs and can change results of the
          service
        </li>
        <li>
          Autonomous agents: represent themselves or their own token holders,
          require verifiable computation
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Agents generally operate using some combination of reasoning/thinking
        processes (via an AI model) and occasionally following defined rules and
        workflows. With advances in AI models and supporting infrastructure, AI
        agents can support experiences that combine the scale and cost of online
        services with the flexibility and personalization of in-person
        interactions, leading to net-better user experiences across a range of
        use cases. But while this future is approaching quickly, making this
        advancement possible at scale comes with a lot of requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agents across diverse agent networks–i.e., the internet of agents–need
        to be able to interact securely and autonomously, make agreements and
        transactions, and have a common standard for communication. Just as HTTP
        and HTML enable any web browser to visit any website, AITP provides a
        standard for agent-to-agent and user-to-agent communication, regardless
        of where those agents run or how they're built.
      </p>

      <p>
        AITP is a big step towards enabling the Internet of Agents: providing a
        seamless, universal way for agents to interact with people and each
        other, affording them far more autonomy and functionality
        and–importantly–the ability to participate in commerce, whether in
        crypto or fiat. More than adding a new AI layer over today's web, we are
        providing a new protocol that fundamentally changes how interactions and
        transactions take place online. We will see new experiences, new
        businesses and business models, and new forms of entertainment emerge as
        the agentic web takes shape.
      </p>

        to explore the GitHub repo, visit <a href="http://aitp.dev">aitp.dev</a>
        . The team welcomes feedback and contributions to AITP, which is in the
        process of integration to NEAR AI Hub (app.near.ai) and various agents
        built by NEAR AI and our collaborators.
